# lfs-setup
Automatic environment configuration for my LFS Build
This is intended only to work for my build currently. If you want it for yours you must change the location of the drives that you're mounting.

Each time LFS needs to be restarted I have to step through all the configuration files again. This will allow me to skip that and run one program to get straight back into it.
